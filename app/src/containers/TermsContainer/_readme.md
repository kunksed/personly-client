### Hello there, I am James Gallagher, a publicly traded person!

Recently, I decided to start offering shares in myself through a system similar to the stock market. This system is built around the Mike Merrill model, the first publicly traded person. The system is designed to help me make better and more informed decisions, that will help me grow as a person.

By purchasing shares in James Gallagher, you are giving me money via a donation. In return, I will listen to your input on all decisions put up for vote based on how many shares you purchase. In essence, the higher my share value rises, the more successful I am and vice versa.

When I submit a Shareholder Question, shareholders will be able to vote on major decisions in my life. Like the stock market, the more shares you own, the more influence you will have on decisions. If you make a decision that ends up creating a positive impact on me, then the value of your shares go up, so you have created value by merely helping me make a more informed choice.

The shares you purchase of me are not like those traded by companies on the NYSE or another exchange. You are not investing in a company or any other entity, so the shares you hold are based on a bond of trust between myself, and you, the shareholder. The technology powering my share market is based on the fundamentals of business and the stock market, and everything has been crafted in a simple way to make participating in this experiment easier.

#### Risks

**Is investing in James Gallagher a safe investment?**

Like all investments, investing in me is risky. We are not a business, and you are not making an "investment" per se, but rather a donation to an experimental stock exchange for myself. If I wanted to, I could take all of the money made and hop a flight to Miami Beach. Investing in James is a high risk investment, and you should only purchase shares if you are able to yield a loss in the end.

I recommend that you conduct due diligence about James before making an investment.
