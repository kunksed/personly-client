### Hello there, I am James Gallagher, a publicly traded person!

The concept of investing in a person is very new (although many innovators are discussing equity investing in people right now) and therefore is consistently changing. However, I have put together a quick guide on how to get started.

#### Step 1: Register

Create an account [here](https://trading.jamesg.app/register) to get started with trading shares in James.

#### Step 2: Deposit Funds

Visit the deposit funds page and enter your card information, alongside the amount of money you want to deposit. All payments are processed through Stripe.

*Please enter the value as "1000" for 10 and "1050" for 10.50.*

#### Step 3: Purchase Shares

After adding money to your investment account, you are now able to purchase shares. Visit the trade page when you want to purchase or sell shares.

*Short selling is not supported on the platform. A $0.05 trading fee is applied to all trades*

#### Step 4: Vote on Questions

All shareholders can vote on questions, with each share counting as one vote that you can make. You can vote on any question (or not vote, or abstain), and also comment on questions as well if you need additional information.

You can expect around 2 questions to be submitted per month that are of significant value to my life.
